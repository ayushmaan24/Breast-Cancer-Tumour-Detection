# Breast-Cancer-Tumour-Detection
This is an algorithm that was developed using machine learning to identify and classify cancer
causing tumors in the breast and help to reduce mortality in females due to these going
unnoticed. We can use these techniques to make tools for doctors that can be used as an
effective mechanism for early detection and diagnosis of breast cancer which could greatly
enhance the survival rate of patients. Our objective is to develop a system that uses medical
images and scans of the breast and identify them as normal or abnormal, and if abnormal,
classify them as benign or malignant.

# ALGORITHM
The final CNN based model will be developed with the help of various layers and functions
described below. There are various types of layers that make up the CNN which are the
convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully-connected (FC) layers. When these layers are
stacked, a CNN architecture will be formed. In addition to these three layers, there are two
more important parameters which are the dropout layer and the activation function.

# DATABASE
The most easily accessed databases and therefore the most commonly used databases are the
Mammography Image Analysis Society (MIAS) database and the Digital Database for
Screening Mammography (DDSM). We have chosen to use the MIAS data set for now.
